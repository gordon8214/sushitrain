# Synctrain on macOS

On a Mac, Synctrain is meant to replace Syncthing.app: one engine, configured from the app, and from its web GUI or its
REST API where a configuration has the GUI enabled. This page records where the Mac app differs from iOS and why.

## Engine settings

The app relies on some engine options and folder defaults: frequent progress updates, quick relay reconnects, a
one-hour rescan interval, no block index (`blockIndexing` off, which saves space), no crash or usage reporting (with
the reporting and release URLs left empty), and on iOS ignored permissions and no file system watching.

- **iOS** applies them at every start, together with moving folders back into the app's container, resuming their
  interrupted moves and turning off their scan progress. iOS has no web GUI or REST API, so nothing else can change
  them, and the app depends on them.
- **macOS** applies them only when it creates a new configuration. An existing configuration is used as it is, so a
  value changed in the web GUI or through the REST API lasts, and an existing Syncthing configuration keeps its
  settings. Folders stay where they are and keep Syncthing's scan progress, which the web GUI shows. In a new
  configuration permissions sync, as in Syncthing (`ignorePerms` is off by default); configurations an earlier
  Synctrain created keep the value they have.

On both, usage reporting stays off at every start (`urAccepted` is -1): the engine is a fork, which must not report to
Syncthing's servers as an unknown build. Folders accessed through a remote file service stay paused. Loading writes the
configuration file only when one of these settings changed it.

While it runs, the app still changes the configuration in these ways:

- It pauses and resumes devices from its own list of paused devices, and pauses all of them while the app is suspended
  or connectivity is turned off for the current network. A device paused or resumed in the web GUI can therefore change
  back; reconciling the two is still to do.
- On iOS it sets the reconnect interval to one second in the foreground and 60 seconds in the background.

The engine never upgrades itself: the app is updated as a whole. Self-upgrade is turned off at runtime and compiled out
with the `noupgrade` build tag (the app also logs an error if a build lacks it), so the update settings in a
configuration don't matter. The gateway's Linux build uses the same tag.

## Starting the engine

The engine takes Syncthing's lock (`syncthing.lock` in its configuration directory) before it reads or writes anything
there, and keeps it while the app runs, so it never works next to another Syncthing on the same directory.

It creates a configuration or a device identity only when there is none. A configuration file that is damaged, empty,
unreadable or from a newer version, or a certificate without its key, stops the start and is left as it is; the app
says why and offers what helps (for a damaged configuration, setting it aside and starting with a new one that keeps
the device identity). A configuration from an older Syncthing is archived as `config.xml.v<version>` before it is
migrated, and a database a newer Syncthing wrote is refused.

## Restarting and shutting down

Restarting Syncthing (from the web GUI or the REST API's `/rest/system/restart`, from Troubleshooting in the app's
settings, or on macOS from the app menu or the menu bar menu) restarts the engine inside the app. It stops the remote
file service (paired devices reconnect once it is back) and Syncthing, loads the saved configuration again, and starts
a new engine with the same lock, device identity and streaming server, and the remote file service again. The app's
screens stay open; changes made while it restarts fail with a message that it is restarting, and the File Provider
hears of every folder once afterwards. If the new engine can't start, the app says why and offers to try again (also
from the menu bar menu on macOS).

A shutdown from the web GUI or the REST API's `/rest/system/shutdown` quits the Mac app, rather than leaving it open
with the engine stopped (on iOS, which has no web GUI, Restart Syncthing starts it again). Quitting the app stops the
remote file service and then the engine, waiting for each a limited time; what they could not finish is recovered at
the next start.
